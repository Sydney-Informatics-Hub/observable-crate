## About this site

This is an experiment in using [Observable Framework](https://observablehq.com/framework/)
to build a self-contained website which allows user to
to explore the contents and structure of an [RO-Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/).

The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/observable-crate/)

Developed by Mike Lynch at the [Sydney Informatics Hub](https://www.sydney.edu.au/research/facilities/sydney-informatics-hub.html)
